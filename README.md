Abstract:

Wine quality is an important factor when determining what wine would be the most popular and best selling. There are many different attributes that affect the quality of wine, such as acidity, residual sugars, and chlorides. Specifically data about red wine was compiled in order to determine the wines quality score or rating based on the mentioned attributes. When training the models with classfication it could be seen that the extra trees classifier was considered the best in terms of mean accuracy alongside random forest classifier, and light gradient boosting machine. The results of this project showed that the extra trees classifier pefromed the best with a mean accuracy score of 0.6716, which was higher than the other classifiers mentioned above.
